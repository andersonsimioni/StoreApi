# .NET CORE 6 REST API

This REST API has 3 CRUDs for Customers, Items, and Orders, also it has a code-first approach for Entity Framework, the data layer is separated into 2 modules named as DataRepository and DataExtensions, the DataRepository module contains all models object of the database, migrations, and auto mapper profiles, there are no DML methods. In DataExtensions we have the DML methods for accessing the database entities, this module uses a new approach to integrate extensions into the DbContext, so all methods will be extended into the DbContext object when using it. Another important folder is the Shared folder, it contains a module named Settings that share the software configuration such as string connections through all common projects in the solution. Also, the Shared folder contains the modules Services and Structs to share more entities through the projects. And finally, our REST API is in the WebApi folder, this API runs in .NET CORE version 6.
